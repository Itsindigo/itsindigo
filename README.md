## Hi there 👋

My name's Matt, and I'm available for hire! I'm on the look out for Senior/Staff level opportunities at Series A/B growth-stage startups. I love to ship software that's a dream to pilot. If you're looking for an engineer, you can reach me:

You can read my CV [@Itsindigo/CV](https://github.com/Itsindigo/CV)

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - How to write _really_ effective Go
  - What's possible with LLM's on stacks like LangChain

### 🔎 Some things I believe about writing great software ...
  - Prototyping is the best way to share and validate ideas
  - Agile is dead 💀 - empower high-agency engineers in low-process environments
  - Healthy, open communication is essential, bonus points if it's asynchronous with a heavy slant towards written communication
  - Great engineering culture is bottom-up, not top-down

### 🪭 I'm a big fan of ...
  - [Directly Responsible Individuals!](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/)
  - [Stacked PRs!](https://graphite.dev/blog/stacked-prs)
  - [Review your own code before anyone else does!](https://x.com/EatsIndigo/status/1803290158185222255)

### 💻 Some Software Practices I love ...
  - [Cloud](https://tilt.dev/) [Native](https://skaffold.dev/) [Environments](https://kustomize.io/)
  - [Distributed Task Processors](https://docs.temporal.io/)
  - [The Ports and Adapters Pattern (Hexagonal Architectures!)](https://8thlight.com/insights/a-color-coded-guide-to-ports-and-adapters)
  - [Low Abstraction SQL ORMS](https://github.com/gajus/slonik)

### 🛠️ My favourite things to work on are ...
  - Nifty little tools that simplify every day tasks
  - Seeing a project through the full life-cycle, from "Is this even possible?" though to a production service supported with real-time monitoring.

### ⚡️ Fun fact ...
  - I ran my first marathon this year!
