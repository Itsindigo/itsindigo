### üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
  - How to write _really_ effective Go
  - What's possible with LLM's

### üîé Some things I believe about writing great software ...
  - Prototyping is the best way to share and validate ideas
  - Agile is dead üíÄ - empower high-agency engineers in low-process environments
  - Healthy, open communication is essential, bonus points if it's asynchronous with a heavy slant towards written communication
  - Great engineering culture is bottom-up, not top-down

### üíª Some Software Practices I love ...

  - [Stacked PRs!](https://graphite.dev/blog/stacked-prs)

### üõ†Ô∏è My favourite things to work on are ...
  - Nifty little tools that simplify every day tasks
  - Seeing a project through the full life-cycle, from "Is this even possible?" though to a production service, scaled to many users, supported with real-time monitoring and observability.

### ‚õ©Ô∏è Some other things I believe ...
  - Fostering a healthy level of self-esteem, and prioritising good sleep will take you farther than anything else you're doing.
  - I try to remember to enjoy the journey and not to be overly focussed the goal. And broadly aim to follow other taoist ideas.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact ...
  - I ran my first marathon ~this~ last year! Yeesh, I should really get to work on something else.
